# Udacity Data Engineering with AWS Nano Degree
--------------------------

Learn to design data models, build data warehouses and data lakes, automate data pipelines, and manage massive datasets.

### Project 1: Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra
Model event data to create a non-relational database and ETL pipeline for a music streaming app. Learners will define queries and tables for a database built using Apache Cassandra.

### Project 2: Data Warehouse
In this project, learners will act as a data engineer for a streaming music service. They are tasked with building an ELT pipeline that extracts data from S3, stages it in Redshift, and transforms it into a set of dimensional tables for an analytics team to find insights into what songs their users are listening to.

### Project 3: STEDI Human Balance Analytics
In this project, learners will act as a data engineer for the STEDI team to build a data lakehouse solution for sensor data that trains a machine learning model. They will build an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline for lakehouse architecture, load data from an AWS S3 data lake, process the data into analytics tables using Spark and AWS Glue, and load them back into lakehouse architecture.

### Project 4: Data Pipelines with Airflow
In this project, learners will work to build high grade data pipelines from reusable tasks that can be monitored and provide easy backfills for a music streaming company, Sparkify. They will move JSON logs of user activity and JSON metadata data from S3 and process it in Sparkifyâ€™s data warehouse in Amazon Redshift. To complete the project, learners will need to create their own custom operators to perform tasks such as staging the data, filling the data warehouse, and running checks on the data as the final step.
